# Mobile-Friendly Pricing Page - Web Dev Internship Task 4

This repository contains the solution for Task 4 of the Web Development Internship. The goal was to convert a desktop-only layout into a fully responsive mobile-friendly website using CSS Media Queries.

## 📱 Project Overview

The project is a Service Pricing Landing Page.
* **Desktop View:** Features a horizontal navigation bar and a 3-column pricing grid.
* **Mobile View:** Uses a breakpoint at `768px` to stack the navigation and the pricing cards vertically for better readability on small screens.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:**
    * **Flexbox:** Used for the main layout (Grid and Navbar).
    * **Media Queries:** Used `@media (max-width: 768px)` to apply responsive styles.
    * **Viewport Meta Tag:** Essential for proper scaling on mobile devices.
